/*
 * You will write a Java application to simulate a simple (unrealistic) bank system. This 
 * bank supports three different kinds of accounts: Checking, Gold, and Regular. 
 * Information common to all account types include account number, balance, and 
 * customer information (customer ID, customer name, etc) of the customer who owns 
 * the account.
 * 
 * The Checking account is interest free and charges transaction fees. The first two 
 * monthly transactions are free. It charges a $3 fee for every extra transaction (deposit, 
 * withdrawal).
 * 
 * The Gold account gives a fixed interest at 5% while the Regular account gives fixed 
 * interest at 6%. Regular accounts are charged $10 monthly as a maintenance fee.
 * 
 * Whenever a withdrawal from a Regular or a Checking account is attempted and the 
 * given value is higher than the account's current balance, only the money currently 
 * available on the account is withdrawn. Unlike all other accounts, a Gold account 
 * holder can withdraw indefinitely. There is no transaction fee for customers with Gold 
 * or Regular accounts.
 * 
 * The system is host-centered program currently supporting only one kind of user â€“ a 
 * bank operator who accesses the system to perform regular system administrative work.
